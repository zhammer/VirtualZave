# The Zave
Freshman year I was assigned to Perkins, a dorm notoriously far from campus and the other freshman residences. By chance, the closet friends I made lived in Andrews – a 15 minute walk away – which felt unbearably long as an 18-year-old.

To solve this dilemma, my two closest friends – who roomed together – raised up one of their bed frames, I acquired an unused school mattress, and we bought a drape. Thus was born the Zave: the "Zach cave."

# The Virtual Zave
For my second semester of computer animation final project, I decided to recreate the Zave in all its freshman year glory in 3D. I modeled, shaded and lit all of the renders in this repo. I made a friend living in the Andrews dorm and measured their bedframe exactly to make the replica as realistic as possible.

My favorite parts of the project were: 1) perfecting the bumpy texture on the metal bars and 2) using a cool script found on a youtube video to twist the christmas-light wire along a pre-modeled path.
